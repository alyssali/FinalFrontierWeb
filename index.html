      <h3>So, what's an exoplanet?</h3>
        An exoplanet, or extrasolar planet is a planet outside the Solar System.
      <br />
      <h3>The state of the galaxy</h2>
        The unveil of the photograph of the black hole in April 2019 sparked a new
        wave of enthusiasm towards astronomy and curiosity in the universe where
        we situate. One eternal question that intrigued humanity since the times
        of Aristotle is whether we have got company in the extraterrestrial space.
        If so, where are they and why we haven’t heard from them? If you care about the answers to these questions and are interested in
        learning the universe as we know today - this is for you!
      <br />
      <h3>Are we alone?</h2>
      For our project, we created a exploratory interface of all confirmed
      exoplanets from the perspective of the earth. We allow users to “tour”
      around the universe and learn more about the distance of these exoplanets
      from us and their similarity to earth, thus helping our target audience
      better inform themselves of the possibilities of life outside of the solar
      system.
